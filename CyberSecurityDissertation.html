                <h3>Abstract</h3>
                <p>This study explores the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and cybersecurity, focusing on the usability and security of web authentication systems. As online platforms increasingly demand robust security, striking a balance between ease of use and effective protection becomes critical. The research investigates common usability challenges, user behaviors, and the trade-offs involved in current authentication methods, such as passwords, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and biometrics. Emerging solutions like adaptive authentication and quantum-safe cryptography are also examined. The findings highlight the need for user-centered design approaches that ensure secure, yet frictionless, authentication experiences.</p>
